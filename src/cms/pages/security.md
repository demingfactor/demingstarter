#### **Your data is protected.**

All data is written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Information that our customers put on our system is stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove choke and failure points.

#### **Your data is sent using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).**

Whenever your data is in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted and sent using HTTPS.

#### **Full redundancy for all major systems.**

The servers we use — from power supplies to the internet connection to the air purifying systems — operate with full redundancy capacity. Our  systems are engineered to stay up even if multiple servers fail.

#### **Regularly-updated infrastructure.**

Our  software infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches. While perfect security is a moving target, we work hard to keep up with the state-of-the-art in web security.

#### **We protect your billing information.**

All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption—the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a PCI-Compliant network.

#### **Have a concern? Need to report an incident?**

Have you noticed abuse, misuse, an exploit, or experienced an incident with your account? Please visit our [security response page](/security-response/) for details on how to securely submit a report.
